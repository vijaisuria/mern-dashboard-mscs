# Multi-State Cooperative Society Management System

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Multi-State Cooperative Society Management System (FRONT-END) built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This system provides various features for managing cooperative societies efficiently.


## Features

1. **Homepage**: The system provides a user-friendly homepage that serves as the entry point to the application.

2. **Device Friendly**: The application is designed to be responsive and optimized for different devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile platforms.

3. **Statistics and Tables**: Users can view statistical information and access organized tables to analyze data related to cooperative societies.

4. **Searching and Filters with Sorting**: The system enables users to search for specific information within cooperative societies and apply filters with sorting options to refine the results.

5. **Various Chart Visualization**: Interactive charts are provided to visualize data in a graphical format, making it easier for users to comprehend complex information.

6. **Multi-Lingual Support Powered by Google**: The application supports multiple languages, leveraging Google Translate API to provide seamless translation capabilities.

7. **Admin Panel CRUD Operations**: An admin panel is available for authorized users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on cooperative societies, allowing for efficient management.

8. **Authentication**: The system incorporates a secure authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify data.

9. **Token-based Authorization**: Token-based(JWT) authorization is implemented to control user access to various features and ensure data security.

10. **Notification Pulling**: Users receive notifications by regularly pulling new updates, ensuring they stay informed about important events and changes within the cooperative societies.

11. **Updating Latest Certificates and Hearings**: The system provides a feature to update and manage the latest certificates and hearing-related information for the cooperative societies.

## Getting Started

To set up the Multi-State Cooperative Society Management System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vijaisuria/mern-admin-frontend.git`
2. Install dependencies for the client: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the current directory and provide the necessary configurations (e.g., API_BASE_URL).
4. Start the client: `npm start`

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before proceeding with the setup.

## Hackathon
This project was developed for the Hackathon conducted by CRCS-2023. The aim of the Hackathon was to encourage innovative solutions in the field of cooperative society management. We participated in the Hackathon with the objective of building a comprehensive system that simplifies the management of multi-state cooperative societies.
